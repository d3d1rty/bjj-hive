        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>Our journey began in the U.S. Army. We served together as Infantryman in the 101st Airborne Division, deploying in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Inherent Resolve. Following our service in the Army, we moved on to college and have since transitioned into professional civilian careers. Richard pursued a career in software development, and Daniel honed his craft of sales and marketing in various industries. Today, we maintain the desire to serve and make a positive impact on the world around us. We started this project with the spirit of Army problem solving in mind in order to further the goals of the communities we care about.</p>

				<h2>11. Your Data Protection Rights under the California Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)</h2>
				<p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. – See more at: https://consumercal.org/about-cfc/cfc-education-foundation/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa-3/</p>

				<p><strong>Our Policy on “Do Not Track” Signals:</strong> We do not track users across websites and thus do not honor Do Not Track signals. Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked. Cookies are an integral component of our application and are required for full functionality; however, we do not implant any third-party cookies, trackers, or beacons for which Do Not Track signals apply.</p>
				<p>You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser.</p>
				<h2>12. Service Providers</h2>
        <p>We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service (“<strong>Service Providers</strong>”), provide Service on our behalf, perform Service-related services or assist us in analysing how our Service is used.</p>

				<h2>3. Analytics</h2>
				<p>We use an in-house solution to monitor and analyze the use of our Service. We do not use third-party services for analytics.</p>
				<h2>14. Payments</h2>
				<p>We may provide paid products and/or services within Service. In that case, we use third-party services for payment processing (e.g. payment processors).</p>
				<p>We will not store or collect your payment card details. That information is provided directly to our third-party payment processors whose use of your personal information is governed by their Privacy Policy. These payment processors adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover.

        <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 18 (“<strong>Children</strong>”).</p>
				<p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Child has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p>
				<h2>17. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
